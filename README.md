# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`
inside the "backend" folder, run the command node server.js to start the server on localhost:3001. There are 2 APIs. One serves the battery details and second calculates the Land Size, Energy required, and cost.  

### `npm test` (First Extra Requirement of the Assignment)
Inside the Server folder is a test case file created to cover the test case for server API calls. Run the npm test to see the test results for the APIs. (First Extra Requirement from assignment)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open (http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

### Navigation Flow => Application Flow

As soon as the application starts, you will land on the About page. 

### About Page (Second Extra Requirement of the Assignment with beautiful User Interface with advanced SCSS concepts)

About Page has considerable details for customers to understand each battery and its specifications. It has been very intuitive to give customers proper insight into each battery to help them make powerful decisions.

### Configuration Page

Configuration Page has batteries with its specifications. Here, the user can enter the quantity of the battery, and as soon as they enter the battery count they will see its placement in real-time on layout as well.

### Click on the Configure Button

After entering the battery quantity Click on Configure Button to see the calculation of the battery

### Modal Pop-up for calculation (Third Extra Requirement of the Assignment)

This is a Special feature. Instead of displaying calculated information on the same page, there is an interactive dialog box to show the calculated details. 

### Carbon footprint reduced (Very Important)

In addition to land size, cost, and energy, I have calculated the Carbon Footprint removed by using such batteries as well. This is very important as it will help the customer to know how they are contributing and helping the environment and society as well by buying these batteries.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
